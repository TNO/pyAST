# pyAST

pyAST is a python framework for building parsers that construct an *abstract syntax tree* (AST), which can be pythonically browsed, searched and modified. We have included a parser for SPARQL statements, i.e., sparqlparser.py, which implements [Sparql v1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/)

Many specific or generic parsers exist, however the reason for developing pyAST is ***TBD***

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the following software:
* python 3.3 or higher (***TBC***)


### Installing

Use of pyAST is based on python code integration, i.e., use of the libraries that pyAST provides. Installation is (to be) supported in two distinct ways: either by cloning the sources from Git and make them available to your code base, or installing the code with `pip`. 
Both ways result in the same setup: having the sources available in your python path.

*Setup by Git*

1. Just clone this project in your local directory, i.e.,
```
$ cd /path/to/my/git/directory
$ git clone https://github.com/TNO/pyAST.git
```

1. Make it available on your python path 
```
Example to be included
```

*Setup by `pip`*
This method *YET TO BE PROVIDED*
